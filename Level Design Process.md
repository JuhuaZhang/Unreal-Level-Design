### Level Design Process

#### Overview

My Level consists of three parts, the first part requires players to super jump as well as dodge bullets, the second part is to get out of the maze, and the third part is to defeat the Boss. After completing the three parts, player could enter the hut behind the Boss and step on the button to complete the level.

#### Process

At the beginning, I had no idea how to design a level. So I simply started my assignment on completing the functions of players and enemies. After I finished the Pursuer and the Mortar, I got stuck on my own enemy. So I started to design my level.

As a fan of Nintendo, especially a fan of *Super Mario Odyssey* , I borrowed its idea to the first part -- jump and dodge. I mainly use the Mortars in this part, creating bullets to hit the player.

For the second part, I borrow the idea of *Genshin Impact*, in the *Genshin Impact*, there're a lot of mazes players can explore, so I just made one.

After the above 2 parts, I gradually realized what I need for the last part -- usually there will be a Boss. So I made my own enemy a Boss, with a larger shape and the combination function of the 2 kinds.

The third part looks like the place in *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* where *Sekiro* met *Juzou the Drunkard*, I did not kill him from the front, instead, I went behind it and defeated it. So in my part3, I placed some obstacles and player can use it to kill the boss from behind.
